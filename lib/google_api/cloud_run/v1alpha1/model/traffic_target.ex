defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.TrafficTarget do
  @moduledoc """
  TrafficTarget holds a single entry of the routing table for a Route.

  ## Attributes

  - configurationName (String.t): ConfigurationName of a configuration to whose latest revision we will send this portion of traffic. When the \&quot;status.latestReadyRevisionName\&quot; of the referenced configuration changes, we will automatically migrate traffic from the prior \&quot;latest ready\&quot; revision to the new one. This field is never set in Route&#39;s status, only its spec. This is mutually exclusive with RevisionName.  Cloud Run currently supports a single ConfigurationName. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name is optionally used to expose a dedicated hostname for referencing this target exclusively.  Not currently supported by Cloud Run. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - percent (integer()): Percent specifies percent of the traffic to this Revision or Configuration. This defaults to zero if unspecified.  Cloud Run currently requires 100 percent for a single ConfigurationName TrafficTarget entry. Defaults to: `null`.
  - revisionName (String.t): RevisionName of a specific revision to which to send this portion of traffic. This is mutually exclusive with ConfigurationName.  Providing RevisionName in spec is not currently supported by Cloud Run. Defaults to: `null`.
