defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.RevisionStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  RevisionStatus communicates the observed state of the Revision (from the controller).

  ## Attributes

  - conditions ([RevisionCondition]): Conditions communicates information about ongoing/complete reconciliation processes that bring the \&quot;spec\&quot; inline with the observed state of the world.  As a Revision is being prepared, it will incrementally update conditions \&quot;ResourcesAvailable\&quot;, \&quot;ContainerHealthy\&quot;, and \&quot;Active\&quot;, which contribute to the overall \&quot;Ready\&quot; condition. Defaults to: `null`.
  - imageDigest (String.t): ImageDigest holds the resolved digest for the image specified within .Spec.Container.Image. The digest is resolved during the creation of Revision. This field holds the digest value regardless of whether a tag or digest was originally specified in the Container object. Defaults to: `null`.
  - logUrl (String.t): Specifies the generated logging url for this particular revision based on the revision url template specified in the controller&#39;s config. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - observedGeneration (integer()): ObservedGeneration is the &#39;Generation&#39; of the Revision that was last processed by the controller.  Clients polling for completed reconciliation should poll until observedGeneration &#x3D; metadata.generation, and the Ready condition&#39;s status is True or False. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceName (String.t): Not currently used by Cloud Run. Defaults to: `null`.
