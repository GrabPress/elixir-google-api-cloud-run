defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.Probe do
  @moduledoc """
  Probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic.

  ## Attributes

  - failureThreshold (integer()): Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - handler (Handler): The action taken to determine the health of a container Defaults to: `null`.
  - initialDelaySeconds (integer()): Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - periodSeconds (integer()): How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - successThreshold (integer()): Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness. Minimum value is 1. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - timeoutSeconds (integer()): Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes +optional Defaults to: `null`.
