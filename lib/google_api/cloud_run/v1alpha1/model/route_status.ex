defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.RouteStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  RouteStatus communicates the observed state of the Route (from the controller).

  ## Attributes

  - address (Addressable): Similar to domain, information on where the service is available on HTTP. Defaults to: `null`.
  - conditions ([RouteCondition]): Conditions communicates information about ongoing/complete reconciliation processes that bring the \&quot;spec\&quot; inline with the observed state of the world. Defaults to: `null`.
  - domain (String.t): Domain holds the top-level domain that will distribute traffic over the provided targets. It generally has the form https://{route-hash}-{project-hash}-{cluster-level-suffix}.a.run.app Defaults to: `null`.
  - domainInternal (String.t): For Cloud Run, identifical to domain. Defaults to: `null`.
  - observedGeneration (integer()): ObservedGeneration is the &#39;Generation&#39; of the Route that was last processed by the controller.  Clients polling for completed reconciliation should poll until observedGeneration &#x3D; metadata.generation and the Ready condition&#39;s status is True or False.  Note that providing a trafficTarget that only has a configurationName will result in a Route that does not increment either its metadata.generation or its observedGeneration, as new \&quot;latest ready\&quot; revisions from the Configuration are processed without an update to the Route&#39;s spec. Defaults to: `null`.
  - traffic ([TrafficTarget]): Traffic holds the configured traffic distribution. These entries will always contain RevisionName references. When ConfigurationName appears in the spec, this will hold the LatestReadyRevisionName that we last observed. Defaults to: `null`.
