defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.RevisionSpec do
  @moduledoc """
  RevisionSpec holds the desired state of the Revision (from the client).

  ## Attributes

  - concurrencyModel (String.t): ConcurrencyModel specifies the desired concurrency model (Single or Multi) for the Revision. Defaults to Multi. Deprecated in favor of ContainerConcurrency. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - container (Container): Container defines the unit of execution for this Revision. In the context of a Revision, we disallow a number of the fields of this Container, including: name, ports, and volumeMounts. The runtime contract is documented here: https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/runtime-contract.md Defaults to: `null`.
  - containerConcurrency (integer()): ContainerConcurrency specifies the maximum allowed in-flight (concurrent) requests per container of the Revision. Values are: - &#x60;0&#x60; thread-safe, the system should manage the max concurrency. This is    the default value. - &#x60;1&#x60; not-thread-safe. Single concurrency - &#x60;2-N&#x60; thread-safe, max concurrency of N Defaults to: `null`.
  - generation (integer()): Deprecated and not currently populated by Cloud Run. See metadata.generation instead, which is the sequence number containing the latest generation of the desired state.  Read-only. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceAccountName (String.t): Not currently used by Cloud Run. Defaults to: `null`.
  - servingState (String.t): ServingState holds a value describing the state the resources are in for this Revision. Users must not specify this when creating a revision. It is expected that the system will manipulate this based on routability and load.  Populated by the system. Read-only. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [REVISION_SERVING_STATE_UNSPECIFIED, ACTIVE, RESERVE, RETIRED]
  - timeoutSeconds (integer()): TimeoutSeconds holds the max duration the instance is allowed for responding to a request. Not currently used by Cloud Run. Defaults to: `null`.
