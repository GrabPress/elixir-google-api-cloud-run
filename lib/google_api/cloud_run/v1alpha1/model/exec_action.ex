defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.ExecAction do
  @moduledoc """
  ExecAction describes a \&quot;run in container\&quot; action.

  ## Attributes

  - command (String.t): Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root (&#39;/&#39;) in the container&#39;s filesystem. The command is simply exec&#39;d, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions (&#39;|&#39;, etc) won&#39;t work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
