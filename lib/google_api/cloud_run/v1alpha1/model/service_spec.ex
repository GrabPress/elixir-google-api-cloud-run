  @moduledoc """
  ServiceSpec holds the desired state of the Route (from the client), which is used to manipulate the underlying Route and Configuration(s).

  ## Attributes

  - generation (integer()): Deprecated and not currently populated by Cloud Run. See metadata.generation instead, which is the sequence number containing the latest generation of the desired state.  Read-only. Defaults to: `null`.
  - manual (ServiceSpecManualType): Manual contains the options for configuring a manual service. See ServiceSpec for more details.  Not currently supported by Cloud Run. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pinned (ServiceSpecPinnedType): Pins this service to a specific revision name. The revision must be owned by the configuration provided.  Deprecated and not supported by Cloud Run. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
  - release (ServiceSpecReleaseType): Release enables gradual promotion of new revisions by allowing traffic to be split between two revisions. This type replaces the deprecated Pinned type.  Not currently supported by Cloud Run. Defaults to: `null`.
  - runLatest (ServiceSpecRunLatest): RunLatest defines a simple Service. It will automatically configure a route that keeps the latest ready revision from the supplied configuration running. +optional Defaults to: `null`.
