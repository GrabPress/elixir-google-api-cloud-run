defmodule GoogleApi.CloudRun.V1alpha1.Model.ServiceSpecReleaseType do
  @moduledoc """
  ServiceSpecReleaseType contains the options for slowly releasing revisions. See ServiceSpec for more details.  Not currently supported by Cloud Run.

  ## Attributes

  - configuration (ConfigurationSpec): The configuration for this service. All revisions from this service must come from a single configuration. Defaults to: `null`.
  - revisions ([String.t]): Revisions is an ordered list of 1 or 2 revisions. The first is the current revision, and the second is the candidate revision. If a single revision is provided, traffic will be pinned at that revision.  \&quot;@latest\&quot; is a shortcut for usage that refers to the latest created revision by the configuration. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rolloutPercent (integer()): RolloutPercent is the percent of traffic that should be sent to the candidate revision, i.e. the 2nd revision in the revisions list. Valid values are between 0 and 99 inclusive. Defaults to: `null`.
